# Subject Transfer using Diffusion Models

Given a small set of images (e.g., pictures of my dog), this method allows to put the main subject of the images in a new context. For instance, the prompt "A picture of <my_dog> wearing a suit." would depict the same dog from the sample images but with a novel variation of "wearing a suit". In this example, <my_dog> is a placeholder token similar to how DreamBooth is implemented, which is also used here. You are free to choose any other way to solve the task.
